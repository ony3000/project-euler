## 92. Square digit chains

A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,

> 44 &rarr; 32 &rarr; 13 &rarr; 10 &rarr; **1** &rarr; **1**<br>
> 85 &rarr; **89** &rarr; 145 &rarr; 42 &rarr; 20 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 16 &rarr; 37 &rarr; 58 &rarr; **89**

Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?
