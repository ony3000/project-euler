## 102. Triangle containment

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 &le; <var>x</var>, <var>y</var> &le; 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

<p align="center">
  A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)<br>
  <br>
  X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)
</p>

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Using [triangles.txt](./triangles.txt), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.
