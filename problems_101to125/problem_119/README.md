## 119. Digit power sum

The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8<sup>3</sup> = 512. Another example of a number with this property is 614656 = 28<sup>4</sup>.

We shall define <var>a</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> to be the <var>n</var>th term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that <var>a</var><sub>2</sub> = 512 and <var>a</var><sub>10</sub> = 614656.

Find <var>a</var><sub>30</sub>.
