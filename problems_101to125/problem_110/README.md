## 110. Diophantine reciprocals II

In the following equation <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var> are positive integers.

    alt="\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{n}"

It can be verified that when <var>n</var> = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of <var>n</var> for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.

What is the least value of <var>n</var> for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?

NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of Problem 108 and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.
