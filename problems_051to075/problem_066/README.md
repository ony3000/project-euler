## 66. Diophantine equation

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

> <var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - D<var>y</var><sup>2</sup> = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in <var>x</var> is 649<sup>2</sup> - 13&times;180<sup>2</sup> = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.

By finding minimal solutions in <var>x</var> for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:

> 3<sup>2</sup> - 2&times;2<sup>2</sup> = 1<br>
> 2<sup>2</sup> - 3&times;1<sup>2</sup> = 1<br>
> **9**<sup>2</sup> - 5&times;4<sup>2</sup> = 1<br>
> 5<sup>2</sup> - 6&times;2<sup>2</sup> = 1<br>
> 8<sup>2</sup> - 7&times;3<sup>2</sup> = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in <var>x</var> for D &le; 7, the largest <var>x</var> is obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D &le; 1000 in minimal solutions of <var>x</var> for which the largest value of <var>x</var> is obtained.
