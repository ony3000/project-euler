## 58. Spiral primes

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

<p align="center">
  <strong>37</strong> 36 35 34 33 32 <strong>31</strong><br>
  38 <strong>17</strong> 16 15 14 <strong>13</strong> 30<br>
  39 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>5</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>3</strong> 12 29<br>
  40 19 &nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;1 &nbsp;&nbsp;2 11 28<br>
  41 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>7</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;8 &nbsp;&nbsp;9 10 27<br>
  42 21 22 23 24 25 26<br>
  <strong>43</strong> 44 45 46 47 48 49
</p>

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 &ap; 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
