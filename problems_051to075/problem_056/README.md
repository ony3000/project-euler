## 56. Powerful digit sum

A googol (10<sup>100</sup>) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100<sup>100</sup> is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, <var>a</var><sup><var>b</var></sup>, where <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?
