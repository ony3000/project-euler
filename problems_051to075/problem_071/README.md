## 71. Ordered fractions

Consider the fraction, <var>n</var>/<var>d</var>, where <var>n</var> and <var>d</var> are positive integers. If <var>n</var><<var>d</var> and HCF(<var>n</var>,<var>d</var>)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for <var>d</var> &le; 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

<p align="center">
  1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, <strong>2/5</strong>, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
</p>

It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.

By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for <var>d</var> &le; 1,000,000 in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
