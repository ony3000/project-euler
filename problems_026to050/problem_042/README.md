## 42. Coded triangle numbers

### Translation
* [한국어](./translation-ko.md)

The <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, <var>t</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> = &half;<var>n</var>(<var>n</var>+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

<p align="center">
  1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
</p>

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = <var>t</var><sub>10</sub>. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using [words.txt](./words.txt), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
