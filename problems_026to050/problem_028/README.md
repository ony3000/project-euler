## 28. Number spiral diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<p align="center">
  <strong>21</strong> 22 23 24 <strong>25</strong><br>
  20 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>7</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;8 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>9</strong> 10<br>
  19 &nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;2 11<br>
  18 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>5</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>3</strong> 12<br>
  <strong>17</strong> 16 15 14 <strong>13</strong>
</p>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
