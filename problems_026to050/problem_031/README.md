## 31. Coin sums

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (&pound;) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

> 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, &pound;1 (100p), and &pound;2 (200p).

It is possible to make &pound;2 in the following way:

> 1&times;&pound;1 + 1&times;50p + 2&times;20p + 1&times;5p + 1&times;2p + 3&times;1p

How many different ways can &pound;2 be made using any number of coins?
