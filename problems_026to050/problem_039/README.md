* [한국어](./translation-ko.md)

If <var>p</var> is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>c</var>}, there are exactly three solutions for <var>p</var> = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of <var>p</var> &le; 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
