## 45. Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

### Translation
* [한국어](./translation-ko.md)

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

&nbsp; | Formula | First few terms
--- | --- | ---
Triangle | T<sub><var>n</var></sub>=<var>n</var>(<var>n</var>+1)/2 | 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Pentagonal | P<sub><var>n</var></sub>=<var>n</var>(3<var>n</var>&minus;1)/2 | 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal | H<sub><var>n</var></sub>=<var>n</var>(2<var>n</var>&minus;1) | 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

It can be verified that T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
